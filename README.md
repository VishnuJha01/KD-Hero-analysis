## Project Overview

- **Organization:** KD Hero (Hero MotoCorp Authorized Dealership)
- **Location:** Darbhanga, Bihar, India
- **Study Period:** July 2024 – December 2024
- **Objective:**  
  Improve inventory management efficiency by analyzing historical sales and purchase data, forecasting demand, and reducing both stockouts and excess inventory.

## Methodology

### Data Collection
- Sales records (579 transactions)
- Purchase records (906 transactions)
- Data sourced from the dealership’s internal ERP system

### Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicate entries using VIN and transaction date
- Standardized date formats and pricing fields
- Handled missing values and reconciled inventory inconsistencies

### Analysis
- **Time Series Analysis** – Identified seasonal demand patterns (festive peaks)
- **ABC Analysis** – Prioritized high-revenue models
- **Regression Analysis** – Evaluated relationship between sales and time
- **Inventory Analysis** – Purchase vs sales comparison
- **Reorder Point (ROP) Evaluation** – Identified inefficiencies of static ROP

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**
  - Pivot tables and charts
  - Descriptive statistics
  - Regression and trend analysis

---

## Key Findings
- **Sales Peak:** October 2024 due to festive demand
- **Top Models:** Splendor+, Splendor+ XTEC, Passion+, Xtreme 125R
- **Inventory Issue:** Purchases consistently exceeded sales, causing stock buildup
- **ROP Issue:** Static reorder point (~50 units) failed to adapt to seasonal demand
- **Market Insight:** Majority of sales occurred in the ₹60,000–₹75,000 price range
- **Slow Movers:** Several models showed low or negative inventory levels, indicating planning and reconciliation issues

---

## Recommendations
- **Inventory Optimization**
  - Implement dynamic ROP based on sales velocity and lead time
  - Reduce investment in slow-moving models
- **Demand Forecasting**
  - Use rolling forecasts instead of static assumptions
  - Incorporate seasonality and festive demand
- **Procurement Strategy**
  - Align purchases closely with forecasted sales
  - Adopt just-in-time or min–max inventory strategies
- **Operational Control**
  - Monitor KPIs such as inventory turnover, carrying cost, and stockouts regularly
